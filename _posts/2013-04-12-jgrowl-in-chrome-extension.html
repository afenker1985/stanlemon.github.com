<p>The other day someone on StackOverflow asked how to integrate <a href="http://github.com/stanlemon/jGrowl">jGrowl</a> into a Chrome extension.  They had a pretty good start, but missed some important details.  I've uploaded a complete working Chrome extension with jGrowl to Github as part of my response to the question.</p>
<p>The question can be found here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15870797/jgrowl-issue-in-chrome-extension">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15870797/jgrowl-issue-in-chrome-extension</a></p>
<p>The GitHub repository with the example implementation can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/stanlemon/jgrowl-chrome-ext">https://github.com/stanlemon/jgrowl-chrome-ext</a></p>
