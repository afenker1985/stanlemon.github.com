<p>For awhile now I've wished that <a href="http://atlassian.com/software/bamboo">Bamboo</a> had an app, or something that could deliver a push notification when a build starts or finishes. Sure there is email, but that means my build notifications will get lost in all of the other junk I am quietly ignoring in my inbox.  What I want is a targeted notification for my builds. So I got to thinking, why not leverage <a href="http://pushover.net">Pushover</a>?</p>
<p>I decided to setup some inline script tasks on one of my bamboo plans using the following code (supply your credentials accordingly), in order to give Bamboo push notifications.</p>

<p>Of course you can kick this up a notch by changing the message, using additional variables and throwing other notifications in at very stages of your build plans.</p>
