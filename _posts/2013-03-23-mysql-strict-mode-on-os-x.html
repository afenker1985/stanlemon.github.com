<p>If you are a web developer on OS X you probably are sporting your own installation of your database server.  If you are running MySQL you might be haunted by strict mode.  MySQL has modes <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-sql-mode.html">as documented here</a> that effect the behavior of various parts of the system.  In strict mode values do not get casted between types, which is where I ran into issues.  My favorite ORM was passing a boolean <em>true</em> into a <em>tinyint(1)</em> and causing the transaction to abort.  This is thanks to <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-sql-mode.html#sqlmode_strict_trans_tables">STRICT_TRANS_TABLES</a> in my case.  The first thing I checked was my <em>/etc/my.cnf</em> to see if "sql_mode" was set in the [mysqld] section.  It was not.  So I tried setting it to something other than <em>STRICT_TRANS_TABLES</em> and restarted MySQL.  No luck, the setting was still on.  After a lot of poking around I found out that MySQL for OS X from Oracle ships with a <em>/usr/local/mysql/my.cnf</em> which is loaded on startup. In this file is a sole configuration directive for <em>sql_mode=NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES.</em>  Once I commented this out and restarted the server strict mode was off, my ORM worked and I was happy.</p>
