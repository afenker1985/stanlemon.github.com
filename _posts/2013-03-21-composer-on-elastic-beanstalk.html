<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk</a> is another git-driven deployment service, this time directly to EC2 and RDS instances on Amazon Web Services.  It's similar to what Red Hat is doing with OpenShift conceptually.</p>
<p>If you are a PHP developer like myself your first question is probably, will it install my <a href="http://getcomposer.org">composer dependencies</a> for me?  The answer is <strong>YES</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's the kicker, and quite frankly this does not make any sense to me...  If you have stubbed your <em>vendor</em> folder in place, so you've either touched <em>./vendor/empty</em> or <em>./vendor/.gitkeep</em>, you are going to have to removed it.  Elastic Beanstalk will use composer based upon the presence of a <em>composer.json</em> or <em>composer.lock</em> file, but if it sees the <em>vendor</em> folder it bails out and doesn't execute the install command. Again, I really don't know why this is and I could not find any documentation about it.  Yet this exactly what I needed to do to get my dependencies installed.</p>
