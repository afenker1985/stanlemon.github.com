<p>If you're using <a href="http://s3tools.org/"><em>s3cmd</em></a> to put files into an s3 bucket and need to do so into <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/">GovCloud</a> you can, but you need to override the end point URL's used for s3.  I had a hard time finding documentation for this, so hopefully this saves someone sometime in the future.</p>
<p><em>s3cmd</em> writes a configuration file, likely at ~/.s3cfg and in it are two options that you are not prompted for when going through the setup process, but are relevant when connecting to GovCloud.  Specifically 'host_base' and 'host_bucket' need to be changed from the default s3 end points, they need to be set like so:</p>
<blockquote><p>host_base = s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com<br />
host_bucket = %(bucket)s.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com</p></blockquote>
<p>Once these are set your GovCloud access key and secret should work.</p>
