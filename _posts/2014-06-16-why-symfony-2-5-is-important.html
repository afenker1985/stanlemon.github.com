<p><a href="http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-2-5-0-released">Symfony 2.5 was released on June 1</a>. I've been following blogs and listening to podcasts about the release and there are a lot of really awesome additions in this release. But there is one feature in particular that I don't believe is getting enough attention and deserves some.</p>
<p>Back in April I wrote about my frustration with <a href="http://stanlemon.net/2014/04/13/symfony-and-absolute-paths/">Symfony &amp; Absolute Paths</a>. I was excited to see in May that this concern found <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/10894">itself into an official GitHub issue and PR</a> and that it might get resolved in a future release of Symfony.  Well it has, and burried under the notes for 2.5 RC1 is this, "bug #10894 [HttpKernel] removed absolute paths from the generated container (fabpot)".</p>
<p>Quite frankly, this is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>huge</strong></span>!  After my post in April I hacked together what I was calling a <em>PathlessKernel</em> to work around this issue.  I basically regex'ed out the application root from the container. In my opinion this was an inelegant solution and thus I chose not to share it. The fix in #10894 is far superior and allows for the regenerating of cache in a CI environment before deployment without all of the path chaos previously created when dumping the container.</p>
<p>This is a big win for Symfony as it makes an application build artifact truly portable!</p>
