<p>I recently decided to signup for <a href="http://pley.com" target="_blank">Pley</a>, a service that supplies lego sets by mail for a monthly membership price.  They advertise that you're safe to lose a piece or two and that the kits are always sanitary using their special <em>FDA grade</em> process.  Unfortunately I found both of these claims to be <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>false</strong></span>.</p>
<p>First off let's set the record straight, I'm an adult Lego geek. That's a technical term, you can check me on it. As a kid I had a vast array of sets and spent countless hours constructing my dreams. Then I went to High School, College and got married and had mostly forgotten about Legos.  Until I took a job where I was working on the hosting infrastructure used by the Official Lego Podcasts, like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/lego-hero-factory-channel/id372652372?mt=2" target="_blank">this one</a>.  Suddenly I had an excuse to play with Legos again, it was work related after all...</p>
<p>I've collected a few sets as an adult, and I fully admit to playing with them from time to time.  <em>I'm not ashamed.</em> When I saw Pley I thought it could be the perfect <em>life-as-a-service</em> for my late night hobby.</p>
<p>I went through the trial and the first set I got was a total bust. The <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Desert-Skiff-9496" target="_blank">Desert Skiff</a> came in the mail and I started piecing it together.  Normally I try to avoid the directions as much as possible, as that adds to the general fun of the puzzle.  But on this one though I had to pull out the book. This probably sounds a little crazy since it's only a 213 piece set, but hear me out. As it turns out the set was missing pieces, to the tune of at least 10! I finally couldn't finish the set because there were so many missing. I logged online an reported the missing pieces and sent the set back in.  I admit that out of frustration I didn't pull everything apart. I hadn't heard back from Pley until this week when they sent this email to me.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Stan,</p>
<p>We hope you are enjoying Pley. We have received your set today. Thank you!</p>
<p>To keep kids happy, we ask all users to disassemble the sets to individual pieces so that each child has the same building experience with no sets arriving partially built.</p>
<p>Here is a note we received from on of our Pleyers:</p>
<p><img src="assets/talsletter.png" alt="Tal's letter:can you separate piece" /></p>
<p>We appreciate you taking a few extra minutes to separate each piece so that other children can enjoy the set equally.</p>
<p>Thanks for Pleying!</p>
<p>The Pley Team</p>

<p>I'm a little more than flabbergasted. I didn't get any replies when I filed a missing-part list! On their website they say,<em> "Lost a piece? No worries. We won't charge."</em> What they don't say is, "<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The next guy might be out of luck though!</span>" Furthermore, if their process is so clean how did this kid <em>Tal</em> get the set still stuck together? How do they know I didn't stick a booger between those blocks?  And really what are they doing sending this kid's letter to me? Surely this is some kind of privacy violation!</p>
<p>The thing I really miscalculated though was thinking that renting one set at a time would somehow pacify my burning desire as a Lego-master to mix and match multiple sets. There simply is nothing better than owning your sets, period.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I just can't recommend this service.  Yeah, it's partially out of bitterness, but I also feel like I've been lied to. So keep buying on Amazon, or Target or wherever it is you get your Lego-fix and steer clear of Pley!</p>
