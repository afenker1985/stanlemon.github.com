<p>tl;dr <a href="http://restdemo-stanlemon.rhcloud.com/#">You can try out LemonRestBundle with ng-admin here.</a></p>
<p>Last week I shared that I was working on a <a href="github.com/stanlemon/rest-bundle">Symfony 2 bundle that would create REST end points from Doctrine entities</a>. I've been continuing to work on that bundle, adding features and flexibility and I decided to re-evaluate the way I was demoing it. The truth is that I didn't want to sink a lot of time into writing a demo, but I also want to do a show more functionality than just pulling down some objects from and dumping them to a page. What I want is to show the full REST life cycle, getting, searching and saving objects to an api. Fortunately there's a really great tool out there that plugs into a REST api and does just that! It’s called <a href="https://github.com/marmelab/ng-admin">ng-admin</a> and it’s from the folks over at <a href="http://marmelab.com/">Marmelab</a>.</p>
<p>For those that aren't familiar with <a href="https://github.com/marmelab/ng-admin">ng-admin</a>, it's a tool written using <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> and it allows you to easily wire up a "stock" UI for a REST API. Like my own project, it's opinionated and convention oriented. Quite honestly it's a pretty cool tool. So I’ve hooked it up to a symfony standard application with the <a href="github.com/stanlemon/rest-bundle">LemonRestBundle</a> and configured some entities to match <a href="ng-admin.marmelab.com">Marmelab’s own demo</a>. I also pulled the sample data down that Marmelab was using and stuck it in a sqlite database. The database resets every minute, but it’s enough time to create a post and edit some comments and see <a href="https://github.com/stanlemon/rest-bundle">LemonRestBundle</a> in action. The really cool part is when you take a look at the demo app’s GitHub repository and realize<a href="https://github.com/stanlemon/rest-demo-app/tree/master/src/Lemon/RestDemoBundle/Entity"> it took three Entity classes to make the whole thing happen</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://restdemo-stanlemon.rhcloud.com/#/list/post">I’ve deployed the demo over at OpenShift so you can take a look and try it out for yourself.</a> You can also clone the <a href="https://github.com/stanlemon/rest-demo-app">demo app from GitHub</a>, run composer.phar install and try it yourself!</p>
