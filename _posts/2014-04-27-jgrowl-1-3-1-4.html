<p>About a week ago I released v1.3 of <a href="https://github.com/stanlemon/jGrowl" target="_blank">jGrowl</a>. This is for all intents and purposes a maintenance release, containing primarily packing info for npm and bower, as well as a Grunt config for future development. More importantly is that the '<em>develop</em>' branch is underway and this contains some significant changes to the plugin.</p>
<p>The 1.4 release intends to address the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>LESS</em> for CSS</li>
<li>Remove IE6 support</li>
<li>Easily use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">bootstrap</a> and include examples</li>
</ul>
<p>These things are currently available for testing, simply pull 'develop' and give it a spin.</p>
<p>Additionally I am very happy to share that the <a href="http://bower.io/search/?q=jgrowl" target="_blank">jGrowl package on Bower</a> now points at the correct repository, meaning you can easily add jGrowl to your project using this excellent package manager.</p>
<p>Lastly, while most of the development on 1.4 is complete I am hoping at some point to work on automating some tests of the plugin. If you have experience doing this with jQuery plugins I would welcome advice, insight or better yet - pull requests.  If you have any feedback on either 1.3 or 1.4 please don't hesitate to drop me a line.</p>
