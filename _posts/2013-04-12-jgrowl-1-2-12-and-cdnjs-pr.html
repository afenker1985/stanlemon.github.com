<p>As promised, with 100+ stargazers on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/1167">I've submitted a pull request</a> to <a href="http://cdnjs.com">cdnjs</a> from <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">CloudFare</a> for <a href="http://github.com/stanlemon/jGrowl">jGrowl</a>. Before doing so I made a minor release update to jGrowl. There are no functional changes in 1.2.12, however I did improve the README to include documentation on the various configuration options and I also added a compressed version of the library with a source map.  If you don't know what a source map is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+source+map">I suggest you google it</a>, because they're pretty awesome.</p>
