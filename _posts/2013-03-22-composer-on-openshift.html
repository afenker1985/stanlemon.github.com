<p>Yesterday I talked about running <a href="http://getcomposer.org">composer</a> on Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk.  There it is builtin and works out of the box for you.  If you are on <a href="http://openshift.com">OpenShift</a> (my preferred PaaS) composer does not come out of the box.  <a href="http://www.mwop.net">Matthew Weier O'Phinney</a> has posted an article on the steps he took to get composer installing his project's dependencies, and that's definitely a worthy read.  However, my deployment hook for OpenShift is a little bit different and I wanted to share that.</p>
<p>There were two things I wanted to accomplish.  First, I did not want <em>composer.phar</em> in source control.  Second, I wanted to take advantage of composer's ability to cache dependencies to speedup my deployment process up.  So here is what I use in my <em>./.openshift/action_hooks/deploy</em> script:</p>
<p>https://gist.github.com/stanlemon/5177925</p>
<p><em>As a bonus here's a tip about markers... OpenShift will restart Apache and Zend Server with every deployment. You may not want or need to do this. If you don't, simply touch a file to ./.openshift/markers/hot_deply and then next time you push your changes up OpenShift will leave all those services running when it deploys.</em></p>
