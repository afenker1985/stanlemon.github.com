My name is Stan Lemon, I am a husband, father, software engineer and Steelers fan.

I live with my wife and two (soon to be three) kids in Southern Indiana.  We recently moved here after a seven year stint in Pittsburgh where I learned how to wave a Terrible Towel and bleed black and gold - _Go Steelers_!  I studied Theology and Biblical Languages at Concordia University River Forest where I received my Bachelor of Arts degree.  After college I took up software development and by day I work as software engineer for salesforce.com.

You can find out more about my software development background from poking around at [GitHub](http://github.com/stanlemon) and [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org/stanlemon).
